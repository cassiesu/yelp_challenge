# Yelp Challenge

Traditional marketing research for restaurants is based on the questionnaires and customers feedback. The output of it is usually limited by the scale of the feedback. To find possible potential opportunities of restaurants of a certain city, Yelp, a restaurants rating website, has provided a dataset that contains restaurants features and ratings. The project uses Pearson correlation and Collaborative Filtering to find the preference of a region. In order to enlarge the scalability of the project, big data technologies, such as Hadoop MapReduce and Amazon Web Services have been utilized during the data mining process. By finding the most favorite features of the popular restaurants, the implementation is able to recommend a certain kind of restaurants which will have better performance in the region. The final result has given a satisfactory increase of restaurant’s rating.

In this work, we describe our efforts to process Yelp raw information and select best features using our model. We put forward to methods for feature recommendation based on Pearson correlation coefficient and compare features’ similarity between cities to find difference which might improve overall customers’ rating. Both tell us the features a business needed that matches what the Yelp market expects. Then we test our system on a larger dataset based on Apache Hadoop software library using MapReduce programming models.
